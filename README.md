weather web application, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a user-friendly interface with a convenient search function. By leveraging a Weather API, the application dynamically presents essential weather details, including wind speed, humidity, and current weather conditions. The interface also succinctly communicates whether the weather is cloudy or accompanied by rain, providing users with a comprehensive overview of atmospheric conditions in their specified city
